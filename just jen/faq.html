                            The sizing for each garment is unique, so we recommend that you check the size charts carefully to order the best size.  We provide equivalent sizes and measurements for each garment.  If you still have questions, you can call us at 310-539-6000 and we can provide more clarification.

                            It depends on the quantity and whether it is a custom design or a design that is shown on our website.   In most cases, custom designs take a day to set up (design) and then a few days for production, but larger quantities might require more time.  You can get more details by filling out the custom request form.  We ship from the Los Angeles area and have several shipping methods.

                            All garments may be machine washed in the gentle cycle, please turn the garment inside out. Like colors should be laundered together. Zippers from other garments washed may pull and snag the delicate items. Garments may shrink substantially in hot water. It is best to line dry the items to avoid shrinkage.
